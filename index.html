    <h2>Cats Rule!</h2>
    <p>Cats Rule! Dogs Druel! Dogs are overated! Cats are so much easier to take care of. They dont smell! Their fur is nice
      and soft and they're not needy!</p>
    <h2>Reed's take on Sandy's Opinion</h2>
    <p>"Agreed. I love dogs, don't get me wrong, but when people flat out say they straight up don't like cats, I usually assume
      there is something wrong with them"</p>

    <h2>something reed likes</h2>
    <p>earth medicines - that stuff is the truth. Not Gingko Biloba, I'm talking about Ayahuasca. Experiencing the death of
      ego is an excellent precurser to living a truly engaging, connected life.</p>
